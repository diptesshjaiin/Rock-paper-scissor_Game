# Rock-paper-scissor_Game

Anyone who has not been living under the rocks must have heard about the game Rock Paper Scissors game. 

Rock paper scissors is a classic two-person hand game in which each participant forms one of three shapes with their outstretched hand at the same time. 

Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if we can implement it using JavaScript? 

The project given below is a simple DOM (Document Object Model) rock scissors paper project.
